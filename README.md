This is my simulation of a blockchain written in python.
My goal is it to deepen my understanding in python and learning how cryptocurrenicies and its blockchains work.

## Description

- Creates a blockhain, which can contain blocks with messages.
- The blockhain can return also its hash and index.
- Wallets can be created.
- Transactions can be created
- Reward for mining

## Installing & Usage

- git clone <https://github.com/MeritonAliu/blockchain-py>
- run the main.py file with python

## ToDo

- [x] Make transactions work, send and recieve amount of money
- [ ] Create coinbase transaction work for first miner as initial reward
- [ ] Store blockchain into file, read from it when starting
- [ ] Create frontend / app
